My first program: A simple calculator made using Python with the help of Tkinter library.
Tkinter is used mainly for GUI programs made in Python. 
To create a replica of the Windows desktop calculator, I made a window with an entry bar at the top and 2-d number buttons below. The entry bar was given special effects. Then, using lambda function, the number buttons were inserted in the entry bar from right every time they were pressed.
Once the '=' button was pressed, the expression in the entry bar was evaluated and the result was displayed to the user. 

Note: For a more detailed version, stack data structure can be used instead of eval() function to evaluate the expression in the entry bar.
